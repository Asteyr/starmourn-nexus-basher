## tips

Invest your first 50 stats into lifeforce. After that, invest your stats into Regen until Regen is maxed. Next, invest stats into your primary damage stat, depending on what class you are, until it is maxed. Finally, the remaining stats can go to your lifeforce. Things can change when you hit end-game and if you're interested in pvp, but this is a stable set up!
